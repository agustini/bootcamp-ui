2. Spotify dependency was added from [here](https://github.com/eddiemoore/angular-spotify)

### Installation

1. Fork this repo to your account.
2. Clone your new repo from `https://github.com/your_github_user/bootcamp-ui.git`.
3. Move to the root directory.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm install -g gulp`

### Folders structure

For a handy usage, you should place your sass,html and js files inside scripts folder. For example, when developing a controller 'homeCtrl' the structure should look like this:
app/scripts/controllers/home/homeCtrl.js
app/scripts/controllers/home/home.scss
app/scripts/controllers/home/home.html

### Tweaks
If using [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/), add property {"atomic_save": true } in Preferences -> Settings-User, to avoid css compile errors on runtime.
